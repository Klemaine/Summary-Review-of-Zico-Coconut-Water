## Question 1

What is the most common sentiment observed in your sample of 50 reviews according to your OpenAI labeled data?

[According to my observation, the most common sentiment is "negative".]

## Question 2

How reliable do you believe these labels are? Look at the respective labels OpenAI has generated for specific reviews, does it seem like the large language model accurately described the user's review? What risk do model hallucinations introduce into this analysis?

[Yes, it looks like the large language model accurately described the reviews. Model hallucinations can inccorrectly label a review causing the analysis to be misinformed.]

## Question 3

Using the most common sentiment, what would you recommend to this Coconut Water producer to improve customer satisfaction? Should they continue to pursue current market/product outcomes, or does there exist an opportunity for this business to improve its product?

[Since most of the sentiments of Zico Coconut Water are negative, I would recommend that the producer of this product go back to the drawing board to improve taste, freshness and overall qaulity. They should not continue to pursue this product until they have made necessary improvements.]
